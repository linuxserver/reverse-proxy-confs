# if emby is running in bridge mode, the below config should work as is, although, the container name is expected to be "emby",
# if not, replace the lines "set $upstream_emby emby;" with "set $upstream_emby <containername>;"
# for host mode, replace the lines "proxy_pass http://$upstream_emby:8096;" with "proxy_pass http://HOSTIP:8096;" HOSTIP being the IP address of emby
# in emby settings, under "Advanced" change the public https port to 443, leave the local ports as is, set the "external domain" to your url and subdomain,
# and set the "Secure connection mode" to "Handled by reverse proxy"
