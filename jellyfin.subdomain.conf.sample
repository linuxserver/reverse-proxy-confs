# make sure that your dns has a cname set for jellyfin
# if jellyfin is running in bridge mode and the container is named "jellyfin", the below config should work as is
# if not, replace the line "set $upstream_app jellyfin;" with "set $upstream_app <containername>;"
# or "set $upstream_app <HOSTIP>;" for host mode, HOSTIP being the IP address of jellyfin
# in jellyfin settings, under Networking > Server Address Settings, leave the local ports as is,
# and leave the "Enable HTTPS" option unchecked.
# Under Networking > Remote Access Settings, change the public https port to 443.
