# make sure that your dns has a cname set for jellyfin, if jellyfin is running in bridge mode, the below config should work as is, although,
# the container name is expected to be "jellyfin", if not, replace the lines "set $upstream_jellyfin jellyfin;" with "set $upstream_jellyfin <containername>;"
# for host mode, replace the lines "proxy_pass http://$upstream_jellyfin:8096;" with "proxy_pass http://HOSTIP:8096;" HOSTIP being the IP address of jellyfin
# in jellyfin settings, under "Advanced" change the public https port to 443, leave the local ports as is, set the "external domain" to your url,
# and set the "Secure connection mode" to "Handled by reverse proxy"
