# make sure that your nextcloud container is named nextcloud
# make sure that nextcloud is set to work with the base url /nextcloud/
# Assuming this container is called "swag", edit your nextcloud container's config
# located at /config/www/nextcloud/config/config.php and add the following lines before the ");":
#  'trusted_proxies' => [gethostbyname('swag')],
#  'overwritewebroot' => '/nextcloud',
#  'overwrite.cli.url' => 'https://example.com/nextcloud',
#
# Also don't forget to add your domain name to the trusted domains array. It should look somewhat like this:
#  array (
#    0 => '192.168.0.1:444', # This line may look different on your setup, don't modify it.
#    1 => 'example.com',
